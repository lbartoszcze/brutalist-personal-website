# ControlAI: AI Security & Compliance Platform

## Project Overview

ControlAI was my first venture as a solo founder, where I built a platform for automatically detecting and mitigating AI vulnerabilities. What started as a personal project grew into a full-fledged startup that addressed the emerging challenges in AI security and compliance.

## The Problem I Solved

As Large Language Models (LLMs) began to proliferate across industries, I noticed a critical gap in the market: organizations were rapidly deploying these powerful AI systems without adequate security controls or compliance frameworks. Regulations like GDPR and the EU AI Act created new requirements that many companies were struggling to meet.

## Technical Implementation

Working independently, I developed:

- A scanning system that automatically detected vulnerabilities in LLM implementations
- Custom guardrails that prevented prompt injection attacks and data leakage
- A compliance framework that mapped AI operations to regulatory requirements
- Integration systems that worked with popular LLM providers

The platform used a combination of Python for the backend analysis engine, React for the dashboard interface, and containerized microservices for scalability. One of the most challenging aspects was building detection systems for LLM hallucinations and potentially harmful outputs that worked across different model architectures.

## Scaling Journey

As a solo founder, scaling ControlAI presented numerous challenges:

- I bootstrapped the initial development, coding the entire MVP myself
- Secured early pilot customers who helped refine the product through real-world testing
- Gradually expanded the platform's capabilities based on customer feedback
- Developed automated deployment systems so I could support multiple customers simultaneously
- Built relationships with regulatory experts to ensure the compliance frameworks remained current

## Key Features Developed

- **Vulnerability Detection**: Automated scanning for AI security issues across model deployments
- **Compliance Management**: Tools to ensure AI systems adhered to GDPR, EU AI Act, and other regulations
- **Guardrail Implementation**: Specialized in deploying protective measures for Large Language Models
- **Cloud Integration**: Connectors for major cloud platforms to simplify deployment
- **Monitoring Systems**: Real-time alerts for potential security breaches or compliance issues

## Lessons Learned

Building ControlAI as my first startup taught me valuable lessons about product development, customer acquisition, and the challenges of working at the cutting edge of technology. As a solo founder, I had to become proficient not only in the technical aspects but also in business development, customer support, and product management.

The experience of taking ControlAI from concept to working product demonstrated that even complex technical challenges can be addressed by a determined individual with the right approach and persistence.
